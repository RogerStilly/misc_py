I am using GitHub as a place to showcase any code that I'm working on.  
For now, I'm working on programming assignments for University of the 
People (UoPeople), because I am studying Computer Science. I'll put any
other scripts or programs that I create on here.
 
Most of my programming experience is in Python.  In 2014. I took a class
from Oregon State University, where we learned Python, specifically for
ArcGIS.  I was impressed with how Python can be used to accomplish 
various tasks that present themselves every now and again.

The first programming class at UoPeople is Programming Fundamentals which 
uses Python to introduce students to programming. Then student's take
Programming 1 and Programming 2 which focuses on learning Java.  At the 
time of writing this, Dec 2015, I am in the Programming Fundamentals
class, and am loving it.
